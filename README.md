Route optimization for electric vehicles on Mars using ACO (Ant Colony Optimization)
# 🚗 Electric Vehicle Routing on Mars (ACO)

This project applies Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) to optimize routes for electric vehicles under energy and recharging constraints, simulating a Mars-like scenario.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Custom ACO algorithm
- Graph structures for route modeling

## 📊 What it does
- Models a terrain with recharge stations
- Computes the most energy-efficient route
- Adapts based on heuristic values and pheromone updates

## 📁 Structure
- `aco_mars.ipynb` — main code notebook
- `data/` — simulated terrain or graph (optional)
- `utils.py` — helper functions

## 🚀 Future work
- Add GUI for route visualization
- Apply to real terrain maps
